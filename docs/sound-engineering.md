# Sound Engineering

* A Sound is a vibration that propogates space in an aocustic wave.

* Humans can percieve sound, for example when air oscillates (by harmonic
  compression and decompression) and this oscillation hits our ear. This is the
  sensation of hearing, and what we hear is represented by the wave.

* A wave can easily be drawn as a wavy line on a piece of paper.

* If we add the appropriate coordinate system, we can approximate our
  our wave-drawing by picking some number of points on the wave, and writing
  them out in succession.

* Now, anyone reading this sequence of points can have a pretty good idea of
  the shape of our wave.

* If we make sure that the X-axis intervals between points remains constant, we
  can save ourselves the trouble of writing out the x-values completely, as we
  know that they linearly increase 1,2,3...

* TODO normalize amplitude \in [0, 1]

* TODO wave is time, sampleRate
